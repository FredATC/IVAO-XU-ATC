To setup the ATC Panel:

Open the IVAO.HTML file in an editing software. At the top of the file there are two lines.
They look like this:

    var VID = "000000"; // Enter your VID in the quotation marks.
    var NAME = "Name Here"; // Enter your IVAO name in the quotation marks.

! MAKE SURE YOU ARE EDITING THE IVAO.HTML FILE. !

Replace the #s with your VID and IVAO Name in the correct lines. Then save and close the file.
The next time you open IVAO.html with your browser, it will be setup with your IVAO account.

You may have to login to the webeye on the panel for the integration to work.

Enjoy!
